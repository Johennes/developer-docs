## Garbage collection

You will see bugs that have been around for years and received very little activity, or bugs that were originally opened as means to track new features, but went out of scope as the overall direction of the project changed.

Closing those bugs will help clean up our Bugzilla searches and keep things more organized.

* Features request (RFE) that are outside our current or future scope.
* Bugs that donâ€™t apply anymore (E.g. old address book issues, UI that has been replaced).
* Bugs left open with the intention of one day fixing it, but do not align with our scope.
