## All Bugs - improve searchability and accuracy / narrow the scope 
* **Set an accurate version number**, the earliest possible/likely version where it reproduces is ideal (eg. the version # of the bug causing the regression). “Trunk” or “unspec” should be changed to an actual number.
* **OS** should be set if the issue is OS specific. (also add to the bug summary as a keyword, eg. “Mac”)
* **Summary is key.**  Improving the summary speeds up understandability and searchability - your improvement can save everyone valuable time. 1) remove extraneous words. 2) add key words that express how the user experiences the issue. 3) add technical/coding info if appropriate, but never remove user symptoms from the summary.
