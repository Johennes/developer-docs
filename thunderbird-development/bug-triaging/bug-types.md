## The Bug Type is Enhancement, Bug, or Task

A bug report can be of 3 different types

1. **Enhancement**
Bugs that are requests for new features, or modifications of existing features. Reports that the user thinks might be incorrect behavior could be classified as bugs, but if that feature behaves as intended, the request is not a bug but a RFE (Request for Enhancement).

2. **Bug/Defect**
Broken functionality, not working properly, crashes, and pretty much anything that is not working as expected.

3. **Task**
Limit the use of Task to meta bugs or internal efforts related to code clean up, architectural restructuring, tests or telemetry implementation. If it affects a user of a current release, it is better categorized as a Bug.
