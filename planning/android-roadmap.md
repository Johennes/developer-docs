# Android Roadmap

### Improve Account Setup

Implement a more automated account setup flow with settings auto-discovery and guided setup steps.

### Folders Drawer UI improvements

Default implementation of unified folder alongside the ability to manage and organize long folder lists.

### Message View UI improvements

Improvements of the content rendering of single message view, better management of contacts, extra info, and attachment through bottom sheets.

### **Material 3**

Complete adoption of the Material 3 UI toolkit.

### Simplified Settings

Improvement and reorganization of the settings in order to offer simpler and more intuitive paths to customization and control.

### K9 -> Thunderbird for Android

Thunderbird for Android will be released once all these major efforts are completed and the most glaring bugs and crashes are resolved in K-9.

Thunderbird for Android will not replace K-9 as both app will be maintained and released at the same time and can be used in parallel.

### Conversation View

Implementations of a threaded “conversation” - similar to the mobile Gmail interface.

### Syncing Support

Implementation of Mozilla Accounts and Sync between Desktop and Mobile.
