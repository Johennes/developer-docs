# Android Roadmap

## OAuth Support for Major Providers

**Expected Delivery: DONE**

Ensure OAuth support for the major providers: Outlook/O365/hotmail, Gmail, and Yahoo.

## Swipe Between Messages

**Expected Delivery: DONE**

Users have long requested the ability to swipe between messages that are in the current folder being viewed.

## Improve Account Setup

**Expected Delivery: Q1 2023**

Currently, the K-9 account setup is not as “smart” as the Thunderbird account setup and will sometimes make wrong assumptions about an account’s server. We will leverage Thunderbird’s auto-configuration service to make K-9 account setup much better.

## Conversation View

**Expected Delivery: Q2 2023**

K-9 users have long requested the ability to view a thread as a “conversation” - similar to the mobile Gmail interface.

## Message View Overhaul

**Expected Delivery: Q1 2023**

Better display messages by default, better scrolling within a message, better default “zoom” so that the message appears at the correct size even if it is formatted in a bad way.

## Simplify Settings

**Expected Delivery: Q3 2023**

Many K-9 users report that the application settings are too complex and things don’t appear where they expect them. Need to better arrange and contextually expose settings.

## Syncing Support

**Expected Delivery: Q3 2023**

With syncing coming to Thunderbird desktop in 114, the ability to sync accounts and other data (such as filters) with the mobile Thunderbird experience should be supported.

## **Tags**

&#x20;**Expected Delivery: Q3 2023**

Currently K-9 doesn’t support tags, even though this is part of the IMAP standard. It’s a relatively easy lift with most of the work coming from UX/UI considerations.

## **Filters**

**Expected Delivery: Q3 2023**

Currently K-9 doesn’t support filters. This is something that users will expect coming from desktop Thunderbird - we want feature parity here.

## **UI/UX Updates**

**Expected Delivery: Q1 2023**

The K-9 interface looks outdated, does not conform to the current material design (Android platform) standards. We intend to bring it up-to-date with these as well as fix some workflow issues.

## Hierarchical Folder View

**Expected Delivery: Q1 2023**

Folders are currently not displayed in a hierarchical way in K-9. That creates a bad UX and makes managing messages in folders a pain.
