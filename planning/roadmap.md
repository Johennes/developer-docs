## Maintenance Sprints

Alongside the primary objective for the year we will continue the effort of improving our codebase, keeping up with the changes upstream, as well as bug fixes and performance improvements.

Some of the efforts of this maintenance cycle are:

* **OpenPGP and S/MIME improvements and fixes**
* **Add-ons API Improvements**
* **Fluent Migration**
* **ESMification**

## Out of scope

As we focus on these primary objectives with the goal of bringing them to full completion, as well as making sure we have enough resources to tackle bug reports and regressions, we won't be dedicating any major commitment to the following areas of the application during this year.

* **Calendar**
* **Chat**
* **Tasks**
* **Settings**
* **Compose**
* **Search**
* **and everything else...**

We will always have dedicated resources allocated to tackle crashes or performance regressions caused by any of these components.
