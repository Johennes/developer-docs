# Roadmap

Below are the large projects planned for the 114 (2023) release of Thunderbird.

## Firefox Sync

#### Expected Delivery: Q4 2022

Syncing between Thunderbird installations and the Android app should work seamlessly. Tags, filters, email accounts and relevants settings should be synced.

## Front-End Redesign

#### Expected Delivery: Q3 & Q4 2022

Update the Mail space with improved UX and UI, some of these enhancements include multi-line message list and "conversational" threads. It will be possible to reply to messages in the conversations area.

#### Depends On:

### "Conversational" View

## Account Setup Hub

When setting up an email, autodiscovery of calendars and address books works really well! But managing accounts and setting up after the first time has lagged. We are updating that experience in 114 with a centralized place to set up accounts, with a consistent experience regardless of when you bring a new account into Thunderbird.
