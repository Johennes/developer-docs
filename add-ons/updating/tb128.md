# Update for Thunderbird 128

This section covers the required update steps for add-ons which are already compatible with Thunderbird 115 and need to be made compatible with Thunderbird 128.

## Changes in Manifest V2 WebExtension APIs

Our WebExtension APIs are meant to be stable, but we are adding new features and since this is a very young technology this might also require backward incompatible changes. All WebExtension API changes are listed in our WebExtension API documentation:

* [WebExtension changes from Thunderbird 115 to Thunderbird 128](https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv2/changes/esr128.html)

The known backward incompatible changes are:

* Introduction of the _**messagesUpdate**_ permission, required to use [messages.update()](https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv2/messages.html#messages-update).

## Introducing Manifest V3

Thunderbird 128 is the first release to officially support [Manifest Version 3](../manifest-v3.md). The required changes to convert a Manifest V2 extension to Manifest V3 are listed in our WebExtension API documentation:

* [Changes in Manifest V3](https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html)

## Changes in Thunderbird Core

Thunderbird WebExtensions can still run legacy code inside [Experiments](../mailextensions/#experiment-apis). Such legacy code has to be adjusted to changes made in Thunderbird Core. All known changes are listed below.

If you have encountered a change which is not yet listed there, please [contact us](../community.md), so we can update the list.

### nsIMsgCopyServiceListener

Changed in Thunderbird 126 (Bug 1887047).

* `OnStartCopy()` -> `onStartCopy()`
* `SetMessageKey()` -> `setMessageKey()`
* `GetMessageId()` -> `getMessageId()`
* `OnStopCopy()` -> `onStopCopy()`

### nsIFilePicker

Changed in Thunderbird 125 (Bug 1878401). The type of the first parameter was changed from `DOMWindow` to `BrowsingContext`. It will fail when a `DOMWindow` is passed in. Every `DOMWindow` has a `browsingContext` getter:

`window.browsingContext`

### Services.logins.addLogin()

The `addLogin()` method has been replaced by the async method `Services.logins.addLoginAsync()`.
